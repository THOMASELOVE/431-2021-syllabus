<div id="what-do-i-need-to-buy" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2 number="1.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> What Do I Need To Buy?</h2>
<p>You need to buy a book, specifically David Spiegelhalter’s <strong>The Art of Statistics</strong>, which was first published by Penguin in March 2019 (and February 2020) in the UK and then by Basic Books in the US in September 2019. You can purchase any of the available versions (hard-cover, paperback or e-reader) online or in your local bookstore for about $20.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~david/">Dr. Spiegelhalter’s website</a> has lots of useful information.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/">book’s website</a> contains R code, corrections and other materials.</li>

<h1 number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Getting Help with 431</h1>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of frustration (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!). <strong>You shouldn’t spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.</strong></p>
<p>Once the course begins, you have several ways to get help from us:</p>
<div id="piazza-is-the-place-to-ask-questions" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2 number="2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Piazza is the place to ask questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will use <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a> this semester to facilitate questions and answers. We’ll be conducting all class-related discussion there, instead of via email.</li>
<li>Find our class page at: <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home" class="uri">https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home</a>. If you’re successfully enrolled in the class, you should be able to sign up immediately.
<ul>
<li>The quicker you begin asking questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you’ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors.</li>
<li>We encourage you to ask questions when you’re struggling to understand anything related to the class, and you can even do so anonymously.</li>
<li>You’ll also be able to help your colleagues by answering their questions (and you’ll get some class participation credit for doing so), as well.</li>
<li>We will use Piazza for all questions <strong>except</strong> questions about <a href="#quizzes">Quizzes</a>. We’ll give you special instructions for Quizzes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are many, many online resources to help you learn R beyond those we provide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Building internet searches (“googling”) effectively is an important skill that requires practice. Don’t be afraid to use search engines to figure out how to code things in R, for example.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> is a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (and that will be you.)</li>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to visit TAs during office hours that are convenient for you, whenever you need help with the course. This is the best way to get one-on-one help, or try out a new idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching Assistant (TA) office hours will be held via Zoom, beginning 2021-08-29.</li>
<li>The schedule for TA office hours appears on the <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html">Course Calendar</a>, and on our <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</li>
<li>Office Hours are held for your benefit. Please visit the TAs, especially if you have questions about how to do things in R, or about the content of the class slides or course notes. They’re volunteering their time to help you, and most of them have been in your shoes in previous years. They want to help you!</li>

<p>If you need to miss a class session, or even two, just review the materials and move on, and please feel encouraged to ask for help.</p>
<p>If an emergency arises that will keep you from timely completion of work that has a deadline, like a lab, minute paper, or the like, send an email directly to Dr. Love saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have an emergency that will keep me from completing (<em>list things you’re worried about completing</em>) in a timely fashion. I will contact you again when I am able to make plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Love will respond with “OK” and temporarily excuse you from things until <strong>you</strong> send a “re-connection” email to make plans for making up the work you missed, at which time he’ll evaluate the situation and together you can make that plan. At no time do you owe us any information about your health or the nature of the emergency.</li>

<p>Life is not “normal” right now. None of us are really okay. We’re all just pretending.</p>
<p>You most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased care responsibilities - you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you might be facing uncertain job prospects.</p>
<p>I’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your labs, do well on your quizzes and projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am somewhat flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified. If you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.</p>
<p>You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you myself, I may know somebody who can.</p>
<p>If you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to us! We will work with you. I promise.</p>
<p>I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.</p>

<div id="course-description" class="section level1" number="5">
<h1 number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Course Description</h1>
<p>PQHS 431 (cross-listed as CRSP 431 and MPHP 431) is the first half of a two-semester sequence (with 432) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent and as little theory as possible. We emphasize the key roles of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research.</p>
<p>The course is formally titled <em>Statistical Methods in Biological &amp; Medical Sciences, Part 1.</em> A more accurate title is <strong>Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research</strong>.</p>
<p>We’ll learn about managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other data science activities. This highly applied course focuses on modern tools for learning from data. We’ll learn a lot of R, and we’ll use RStudio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and help perform our research in rigorous and replicable ways.</p>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2 number="5.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Course Objectives</h2>
<p>During the 431-432 sequence, students will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use modern data science tools to import, tidy/manage, explore (through transformation, visualization and modeling) and communicate about data.</li>
<li>Think hard and well about rigorous design and analysis in scientific research.</li>
<li>Gain sufficient background in the practical issues regarding linear and generalized linear models to give you a starting place for meaningful applied work, particularly in terms of making comparisons to address general types of statistical and analytic questions (exploratory, predictive, inferential, and causal, in particular.)</li>
<li>Learn about the importance of replicable research, and develop facility and practice in open source tools for doing it.</li>
<li>Complete a series of assignments designed to help you demonstrate what you’ve learned.</li>
<li>Program (“Code”) in R sufficiently to accomplish the tasks above, with enough self-sufficiency afterwards to be able to debug and use new R tools without substantial troubleshooting help. What separates “doing data science” from “doing data analysis” is programming.</li>
</ol>

<div id="key-topics-in-431-and-432" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2 number="5.2"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Key Topics in 431 and 432</h2>
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a course in mathematical statistics or statistical inference. It’s far more applied than that.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis: “All graphs are comparisons” including data exploration, statistical graphics and more general visualization of information.</li>
<li>Placing biological, medical and health research questions into a statistical framework.</li>
<li>Study Development - making choices in designing and executing the collection and aggregation of data.</li>
<li>Data Handling - including important issues in importing, tidying and transforming data, as well as methods for dealing with missing data, including imputation.</li>
<li>Statistical Comparisons: “All of statistics are comparisons” - including methods for discrete and continuous variables: intervals, assumptions, some thoughts on statistical power, and the bootstrap, design of visualizations and models for rates, proportions and contingency tables.</li>
<li>The proper and rigorous use of multi-predictor models for continuous and discrete data, including…
<ul>
<li>Fitting, evaluating, and interpreting linear and generalized linear models.</li>
<li>Prediction and validation.</li>
<li>Critical role of graphics, including diagnostics and residual analysis.</li>
<li>Model choice, including variable selection, shrinkage and model uncertainty.</li>
<li>Dealing with categorical predictors and interactions meaningfully.</li>
<li>Causal inference using regression: controlling for covariates meaningfully.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using R and RStudio to make all of the things above happen; with particular emphasis on doing replicable research and using Markdown to document the work.</li>
</ol>

<h2 number="5.3"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> The 431 course is split in two parts.</h2>
<p><strong>Part A</strong> (Classes 1-17, roughly) is mostly about R, Visualizing Data and Making Comparisons.</p>
<p>Project A is focused on the material from this part of the course.</p>

</div>
<div id="what-we-expect-you-to-know-already" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2 number="5.4"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> What We Expect You To Know Already</h2>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>Useful prior experience includes training/experience in statistics, coding/programming and biology/biomedical science. We expect most people will have some experience in one or two of these areas, but very few will have all three.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some students have lots of prior training in statistics. But there are many students in the class with no statistical training at all that they use regularly. We assume only that everyone knows what an average is, and has some sense of why statistics might be useful to them in their chosen field.<br />
</li>
<li>Some students have lots of prior coding and programming experience, including experience with R. Some have never written a line of code in their life. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn how to do modern work with data, and that means writing computer code, but that some people will be starting from nothing.</li>
<li>Some students have lots of prior experience with biological and biomedical science, and know a lot of useful things in those areas which relate directly to our work. Others have zero experience in this area, and will learn a lot from their colleagues. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn, and to put in some effort to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>People succeed in this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology, health or medicine. There will be multiple people in the class who are years away from their last statistics class. We expect the majority of students will have no prior experience using R, or any meaningful recollection of using statistical software.</p>
<p>The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience.</p>

<p>Thomas E. Love, Ph.D.</p>
<p>Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics.</li>
<li>I direct the <a href="https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute/biostatistics-and-data-sciences">Biostatistics and Data Science Division</a> at the <a href="https://www.metrohealth.org/population-health-research-institute">Population Health Research Institute</a> and at the Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, which are jointly supported by The MetroHealth System and by CWRU.</li>
<li>For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for <a href="http://betterhealthpartnership.org/">Better Health Partnership</a>, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there.</li>
<li>I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 <a href="https://students.case.edu/traditions/awards/diekhoff/">John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching</a> from CWRU.</li>
<li>I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management.</li>
</ul>
<p>In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services.

<p>Dr. Love maintains a set of <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/">Course Notes</a>, titled <strong>Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research: Notes for 431.</strong> Professor Love revises the Notes every year, and so they appear in pieces as the semester progresses.</p>
<p>Although these Notes share some of the features of a textbook, they are neither comprehensive nor completely original. The main purpose is to give 431 students a set of common materials on which to draw during the course, providing a series of examples using R to work through issues that are likely to come up during the semester, and in later work.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>slides</strong> and video recordings from each of Professor Love’s lectures, plus other in-class materials from each session of the class will be posted for your use in a timely fashion throughout the semester.</p>

<p>During the course, we will read David Spiegelhalter’s <strong>The Art of Statistics</strong>, which was first published by Penguin in March 2019 (and February 2020) in the UK and then by Basic Books in the US in September 2019. You can purchase any of the available versions (hard-cover, paperback or e-reader) online or in your local bookstore for about $20.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~david/">Dr. Spiegelhalter’s website</a> has lots of useful information.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/">book’s website</a> contains R code, corrections and other materials.</li>
<li>You are welcome to read this book before class starts, if you’d like to get a jump on things, but that’s not necessary: we’ll link readings to the syllabus when that becomes available.</li>

<div id="on-software-and-r" class="section level1" number="10">
<h1 number="10"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> On Software, and R</h1>
<p>The course makes heavy use of the R statistical programming language, and several related tools, most especially the RStudio development environment. Every bit of this software is free to use, and open-source.</p>
<p>You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be many people in the course for whom R is a new experience. I assume no prior R work in the course. You will know a fair amount of R (and some other things, too) after taking the course, though.</li>
<li>We’ll also be using the R Markdown tool within RStudio. R Markdown will be taught in our class, and can be used to generate reproducible reports that appear as .html files, PDF files or Word documents, among other things.</li>
<li>For some people, working with R is the best part of the class, and the part that they’re most excited about.</li>
<li>For others, it’s a real source of anxiety. We understand and encourage patience. There will definitely be some pain, but our experience is that things are much smoother for most people by early October than they appear to be in August.</li>
</ul>
<div id="r-and-rstudio" class="section level2" number="10.1">
<h2 number="10.1"><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> R and RStudio</h2>
<p>You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org">programming language R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard. R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. Information about getting R and RStudio on your computer will be found below in the <a href="#getting-the-software">Getting the Software</a> section of this Syllabus, and this material is also available on the <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/">main course web site</a>.</p>
<p>Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham-the chief scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like <code>ggplot2</code> <a href="https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/">made this wise observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to the teaching assistants, talk to classmates, ask questions, e-mail Dr. Love, etc.</p>
<p>I promise you can do this.</p>
<p>Some of this material is also borrowed from Andrew Heiss, for instance, from <a href="https://evalf19.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/">here</a> and <a href="https://econf20.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/">here</a>.</p>

<div id="system-requirements" class="section level2" number="10.2">
<h2 number="10.2"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> System Requirements</h2>
<p>You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. Whether or not you want to bring that computer to class is up to you. All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU, so there is nothing to buy in terms of software.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course.</li>
<li>You will need a computer, either PC (running Windows 10 would be helpful) or Macintosh (running a reasonably recent OS), but your choice should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life. RStudio and R will look and work the same on either a PC or a Macintosh.</li>
<li>We <strong>do not</strong> recommend the use of a Chromebook for 431 or 432.</li>
<li>R and RStudio Desktop also run on Linux systems but Dr. Love knows essentially nothing about that. Consult the documentation <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">at CRAN for R</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">at the download page for RStudio</a>.</li>

<h2 number="10.3"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Why do we teach R, instead of SPSS or SAS or whatever, in 431-432?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Because it is by far the better choice for what we’re trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period.</li>
<li>Because being a data scientist means writing code and actually doing (not just talking about) replicable research, which R facilitates in an immense variety of ways.</li>
<li>Because R is free to you, me and everyone, and its community is a daily delight.</li>
</ol>
<p>To read comments from other people on the subject, I suggest reading <a href="https://rbasics.netlify.com/2-whyr">Why R?</a> from Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy.</p>
<p>Also, the question of “Why R and not SPSS?” was nicely addressed by Greg Snow in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3787231/r-and-spss-difference">this 2010 post at StackOverflow</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When talking about user friendliness of computer software I like the analogy of cars vs. busses: Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars on the other hand require much more work, you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers licence). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transfering between busses. Using this analogy programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the passenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to learn how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in getting started with the tools you’ll be using in 431 before the class gets rolling, the great folks at <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/">RStudio Education</a> provide <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/">these 6 ways to begin learning R</a>. Pick the one that appeals to you, and give it a shot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that if you’re having trouble installing things, you can still learn a lot about R, RStudio and Data Science basics with the interactive tutorials at <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re already a strong coder, and have some R experience, there are also <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/learn/intermediate/">learning pathways for intermediates at RStudio Education</a> which might be appealing to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to get everyone well into the intermediate level by December. Some people will get there in September, for others it will take longer. But you can do this, and we’ll be there to help you.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many, many online resources to help you with working in R, and we’ll point you to many of the best of them during the semester. For now, we suggest those listed above in the Getting Started with R section.</p>

<h1 number="12"><span class="header-section-number">12</span> General Course Policies</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Any concerns or questions regarding these general policies, the teaching assistants or the course itself should be directed to Professor Love, if at all possible.</li>
<li>All student work is subject to the University’s policies and procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Registration is required</strong>. I do not permit anyone to audit the course who has not previously taken it, without exception. If you’ve taken the course before and want to sit in again, you will need to volunteer or be hired as a teaching assistant.</li>
<li><strong>Grading</strong>. Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade.</li>
<li><strong>Attendance</strong> is expected, but it is also expected that sometimes life will intervene. All students are expected to attend all class sessions in compliance with University policies.
<ul>
<li>If you need to miss two or more classes in a row, inform Professor Love via email beforehand, or as soon as possible thereafter. I will assume you have a good reason - details are <strong>not</strong> necessary.</li>
<li>You are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for your absence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Submissions</strong> In this class, it is far better to turn in timely, but only partially complete work than nothing at all.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback on assignments - deadline.</strong> On every assignment, Lab, Quiz, project-related task, whatever, we will be delighted to respond to questions <strong>up to 12 hours before</strong> the assignment is due. After that time, you may wind up on your own. The reason for this is that Professor Love and the teaching assistants will regularly post responses to frequently asked questions about assignments, and we need sufficient time to accomplish this task.</li>
<li><strong>On Getting Help Quickly and Effectively</strong>: In general, we don’t have a way to diagnose your problem with R, RStudio or Markdown if you don’t show us what you’re typing that causes an error, or a lack of results. If you wrote a Markdown file, we need to see it, along with a specific question (or series of them) about specific error messages or strange results you are getting. We need to replicate the problem in order to know how to fix your problem, and it also helps if we know what error message you’re seeing, or what strange result you are getting.</li>
<li><strong>Distractions</strong>. Silence your phone during class. The temptation to look at your phone or Facebook or email during class is nearly irresistible. Resist anyway, if only to avoid distracting your instructor and your fellow students.</li>
<li><strong>Research Usage</strong>. Any and all results of in-class and out-of-class assignments and activities are data sources for research and may be used in published research. All such use will always be anonymous.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-Recording.</strong> It is our intention to provide audio recordings of each class after they are complete. You should assume that anything you say <em>will</em> be recorded.</li>
<li><strong>Typos.</strong> Professor Love makes occasional typographic and grammatical errors, which irritate him enormously. Please post to <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a> the details of any typos or errors you find in this syllabus or any other course materials. If you are the first to let us know, and we make the change, you will receive some credit in your class participation grade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, all Case Western Reserve University policies apply to this class. To the extent that those policies are unclear, I would regard an appropriate code of conduct as mirroring <a href="https://github.com/RConsortium/RCDI-WG/blob/master/conduct/code-of-conduct.md">this one from the R Consortium</a>.</p>

<div id="can-i-audit-431-or-432" class="section level3" number="12.1.1">
<h3 number="12.1.1"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.1</span> Can I audit 431 or 432?</h3>
<p>No. Enrolled students and teaching assistants are the only people permitted to attend the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-it-possible-to-take-the-course-passfail" class="section level3" number="12.1.2">
<h3 number="12.1.2"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.2</span> Is it possible to take the course pass/fail?</h3>
<p>No, it is not. However, no student in the past five years has received a final course grade other than A, B or Incomplete.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-i-know-how-im-doing-in-the-class" class="section level3" number="12.1.3">
<h3 number="12.1.3"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.3</span> How will I know how I’m doing in the class?</h3>
<p>We aim for substantial and timely feedback from the teaching assistants and myself on all elements of the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-i-take-431-do-i-have-to-also-take-432-in-the-spring" class="section level3" number="12.1.4">
<h3 number="12.1.4"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.4</span> If I take 431, do I have to also take 432 in the Spring?</h3>
<p>It is the natural thing to do. The 431 course is part 1 of a two-semester sequence. Frankly, 432 contains some of the most interesting material and is generally regarded by students who take both as the more entertaining course. Every year, some students take only 431, though. The decision is up to you. The 432 course assumes you have completed 431.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-i-have-to-be-in-cleveland-to-take-this-course" class="section level3" number="12.1.5">
<h3 number="12.1.5"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.5</span> Do I have to be in Cleveland to take this course?</h3>
<p>Yes, and you should expect to be in the Cleveland area through December 9.</p>
</div>

<h3 number="12.1.6"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.6</span> Will all class materials be available to me online?</h3>
<p>Yes, all slides and many other materials will be provided to you. We hope that at least most class sessions will also be audio-recorded and made available to you after class.</p>

<div id="how-do-i-get-connected-to-zoom-through-cwru" class="section level3" number="12.1.7">
<h3 number="12.1.7"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.7</span> How do I get connected to Zoom through CWRU?</h3>
<p>By now, you’re probably familiar with Zoom. We ask that you review <a href="https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information">the CWRU Knowledge Base for Zoom</a> and get familiar with your Zoom account.</p>
<p>At this point, we anticipate one pre-recorded class (Class 3) which will be delivered using Zoom.</p>

<div id="deliverables-assignments" class="section level1" number="13">
<h1 number="13"><span class="header-section-number">13</span> Deliverables / Assignments</h1>
<p>Course deliverables (assignments) include (in increasing order of importance):</p>
<ul>
<li>minute papers (and class participation)</li>
<li>labs</li>
<li>quizzes, and</li>
<li>projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/">main course website</a> will provide details on all of these deliverables to you. This syllabus material describes each in general terms, and provides some guidance on what happens after the deadline for each.</p>
<div id="deadlines-for-deliverables" class="section level2" number="13.1">
<h2 number="13.1"><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Deadlines for Deliverables</h2>
<p>All deadlines for deliverables are posted as part of the Course Calendar, found on <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/">the main web site</a>. The Course Calendar is the final word for all deadlines.</p>
</div>
<div id="minute-papers-and-class-participation" class="section level2" number="13.2">
<h2 number="13.2"><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Minute Papers (and Class Participation)</h2>
<p>During the semester, there are <strong>eleven</strong> Minute Papers scheduled. In this class, a Minute Paper is a short survey (completed using a Google Form) where you will answer a few questions about how the course is going for you. To complete the Minute Paper, you’ll need to log into Google with your CWRU account. The pre-class survey uses a similar format, but is more extensive than a typical Minute Paper.</p>
<p>Each Minute Paper ideally takes less than five minutes to complete, and is best done right at the end of Tuesday’s class. The Minute Papers are actually due at noon Wednesday most weeks to give you some time to reflect, if you’d like, or if you’re in a hurry at the end of Tuesday’s class.</p>
<p>You <strong>should</strong> complete the Minute Paper even if you weren’t able to attend the most recent class.</p>
<p>Professor Love reserves the right to change the number of minute papers depending on how the class is going during the semester.</p>
<div id="grading-class-participation" class="section level3" number="13.2.1">
<h3 number="13.2.1"><span class="header-section-number">13.2.1</span> Grading Class Participation</h3>
<p>Only Professor Love sees the results of the Minute Papers with identifying information. He then summarizes findings without identifying people and addresses those in the Thursday class whenever possible.</p>
<p>Student Class Participation grades are determined by Dr. Love out of a maximum of 100 points. This determination is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 points for completing the <a href="https://bit.ly/431-2021-welcome-survey">Welcome to 431 survey</a> that most of you did prior to class, and if you haven’t done it, please do so now.</li>
<li>plus up to 55 additional points for Minute Paper responses (5 points for each on-time submission)</li>
<li>plus up to 25 bonus points for actions that help the class, as awarded during the semester</li>
</ul>
<p>These bonus points have a small impact, generally, but include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>finding typographical or coding errors in Professor Love’s slides, notes and other published materials.</li>
<li>asking especially helpful questions in the Minute Papers or on <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a></li>
<li>providing helpful responses to questions on <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a></li>
<li>identifying interesting visualizations or uses of ideas we’re discussing in class in the popular or scientific media (this is also done via <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a>)</li>
<li>plus a few other things that come under the general heading of “being helpful.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the bonus, scores up to 105 / 100 in Class Participation are technically possible. Bonus credit is capped so that no one’s class participation score will exceed 105 points.</p>

<p>We cannot emphasize enough how much we want to hear from you about things that are relevant to this course.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you’re not shy, ask questions during class. Come to the (virtual) TA office hours if you need help.</li>
<li>Contribute to <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a> with questions, answers and helpful comments. That’ll help us recognize you as someone trying to improve their understanding.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you find <strong>typos</strong> in the materials (code, slides, the Notes, this syllabus) send them to us on <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a>.</li>
<li>See a cool visualization online (of anything other than COVID-19 data)? A nice use of statistical methods or design in a paper? Share them with us on <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Email Dr. Love if you want to discuss something that doesn’t fit on Piazza or in a conversation with a TA. Visit with him before or after class. Make an appointment to talk with him if you have something to discuss that doesn’t work well in email.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It’s always helpful if Dr. Love knows who you are, and this is an especially difficult thing to achieve this year with a large class just getting used to returning to in-person classwork.</li>

</div>
<div id="labs" class="section level2" number="13.3">
<h2 number="13.3"><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Labs</h2>
<p>During the semester, there are <strong>eight</strong> lab assignments scheduled. Professor Love reserves the right to change the number of labs depending on how the class is going during the semester.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most require straightforward demonstrations of mastery for core principles and fundamental skills. Some require deeper dives into more technically sophisticated material.</li>
<li>Most labs ask you to clean/visualize/analyze some data that we provide to you, and also to react to something we’re reading at the same time in the Spiegelhalter book.</li>
<li>You should anticipate that some coding in R <strong>and</strong> writing at least one essay will be required in most labs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each lab includes instructions as to how to make your submission, usually through <a href="https://canvas.case.edu">Canvas</a>. The course’s primary listing on Canvas is PQHS 431, but students in CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for each Lab will appear in time for you to submit the work, usually just after the deadline for the preceding Lab has passed.</p>
<p>Each lab is associated with a deadline. Late work is permitted, but penalized (see the Grading section below.)</p>
<div id="lab-x" class="section level3" number="13.3.1">
<h3 number="13.3.1"><span class="header-section-number">13.3.1</span> Lab X</h3>
<p>There are seven main Labs (labeled Lab 01 - Lab 07) and an additional assignment called Lab X which involves building a website for yourself. See the Lab X instructions for more details.</p>

<h3 number="13.3.2"><span class="header-section-number">13.3.2</span> A few tips for Early Lab Work</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When writing anything for this course in English, use complete sentences, not just bullet points.</li>
<li>Clearly mark each Question in each Lab. There is no need to repeat the question before answering it, although you are welcome to do so.</li>
<li>You are welcome to discuss each Lab with anyone, including Professor Love, the teaching assistants, or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. We especially encourage you to take advantage of TA office hours and <a href="https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431/home">Piazza</a>.</li>
<li>In general, we do not guarantee to provide answers to questions that we receive in the last 12 hours before a Lab is due, especially once we’ve gotten into mid-September. So don’t leave anything until the last day. Allow time for computer problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>More information (and the actual Lab assignments) will be found on <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/">our main course web site</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading-labs" class="section level3" number="13.3.3">
<h3 number="13.3.3"><span class="header-section-number">13.3.3</span> Grading Labs</h3>
<p>The seven Main Labs are graded by the Teaching Assistants, according to the rubric and answer sketch. Unless otherwise indicated, everything counts, including the quality of the presentation, as well as the coding and statistical work.</p>
<p>For each of these 7 Labs, we publish a detailed answer sketch (within 48 hours of the deadline). Later, when the grades become available (roughly one week after the deadline) you will also receive the grading rubric used by the teaching assistants. You should expect to receive your grade on each Lab you submit on time roughly one week after the deadline. Along with the grade, on-time labs will receive modest feedback about the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Labs received on time can receive up to 100% of the available points for the lab.</li>
<li>Labs received after the deadline but before the answer sketch is published can receive up to 90% of available points.</li>
<li>Lab submissions received after the answer sketch is published but still within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.</li>
<li>Lab submissions received more than one week after the deadline will not be graded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your lowest lab score (out of the first 7) over the course of the semester will be dropped before we calculate your grade on labs.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a result, you can skip one lab during the semester without penalty.</li>
<li>If you decide to skip a lab, please submit a note to Canvas by the deadline saying that you are skipping the lab.</li>
<li>Should you run the risk of needing to miss more than one lab during the semester, contact Dr. Love via email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grading for Lab X will be discussed in the Lab X instructions.</p>
</div>
<div id="appeal-policy---request-a-review-in-december" class="section level3" number="13.3.4">
<h3 number="13.3.4"><span class="header-section-number">13.3.4</span> Appeal Policy - Request a Review in December!</h3>
<p>Clarification of concerns related to potential typographical or other errors in our Lab answer sketches is welcome at any time, but haggling over points on assignments can be a real time sink in a large class. To that end, students are <strong>requested not to dispute</strong> any grading on Labs during the semester, but instead to request a review using a Google Form to be opened by Professor Love in December.</p>
<p>Should you receive a lower grade on a Lab than you feel you deserve based on the feedback the TA provides, the answer sketch and the grading rubric, you can submit a request for a regrade by Professor Love by submitting a request through a Google Form he will provide to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs">the course’s Labs page</a>, we include a section about Grading Errors and Regrade Requests. There, you’ll find a link to a Google form (you must log into Google via CWRU to see it) listing all of the Labs. Any student who wishes to dispute points can specify the number of points in question for each item, and the details of the issues that concern them.
<ul>
<li>If you wish to dispute a grade, just fill out the form at any time before the deadline in December. You can edit the form after submitting it so that you can add additional requests up until the end of the semester.</li>
<li>All forms must be submitted by the deadline in December specified on the Course Calendar.</li>
<li>Disputing a grade on a homework with a teaching assistant is pointless.</li>
<li>Professor Love is responsible for all final grading decisions, and if you have a concern, you should submit your request through the form.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Students are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>In mid-December, <strong>after</strong> Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests on the form and determine for each whether the student’s letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he won’t even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.)</p>
<p>The main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to express their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<div id="quizzes" class="section level2" number="13.4">
<h2 number="13.4"><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Quizzes</h2>
<p>During the semester, you will have three quizzes to complete. See the <a href="https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html">Course Calendar</a> for deadlines, and the <a href="https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes">Course Quiz page</a> for other details.</p>
<p>Each quiz is taken online via a Google Form (like the Minute Papers or the <a href="https://bit.ly/431-2021-welcome-survey">Welcome to 431 survey</a>.) Each quiz includes both short-answer and multiple-choice items. The quizzes focus on whether you can apply the tools developed in class to address small problems.</p>
<p>You will typically receive access to the quiz a few days before it is due, and each quiz will be designed to take 4-6 hours to complete, so the time pressure should be minimal. <strong>If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible</strong>, at least a week before a Quiz is released.</p>

<li>The questions are not arranged in any particular order, and you should answer all questions.</li>
<li>All questions involve relatively short responses, sometimes after working through a detailed analysis.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the deadline.</li>
<li>You are welcome (even encouraged) to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are <strong>not</strong> allowed to discuss the questions on the Quizzes with anyone other than Professor Love or the teaching assistants.</li>
<li>We do not guarantee to answer questions we receive about the Quiz less than 3 hours prior to the Quiz submission deadline. As noted above, we will <strong>not</strong> use Piazza for Quiz questions, but instead an alternate approach we will provide to you with each quiz.</li>

<div id="determining-course-grades" class="section level1" number="14">
<h1 number="14"><span class="header-section-number">14</span> Determining Course Grades</h1>
<p>Over the past five years, all students taking the course have eventually earned either an “A,” a “B” or an “Incomplete” in 431. I don’t see a reason why this won’t also be the case this year.</p>
<div id="grading-breakdown" class="section level2" number="14.1">
<h2 number="14.1"><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Grading Breakdown</h2>
<p>Grading standards apply in the same way for all students, regardless of whether they are enrolled in PQHS 431, CRSP 431 or MPHP 431. The courses are identical.</p>
<p>The course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment.</p>
<p>Course grades are based primarily on performance on labs, projects and quizzes. Your grade on each of these three elements will be determined separately. Then I will combine these elements as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Element</th>
<th>Weight 1</th>
<th>Weight 2</th>
<th>Weight 3</th>
<th>Weight 4</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Labs</td>
<td>35%</td>
<td>30%</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Projects</td>
<td>45%</td>
<td>40%</td>
<td>35%</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Quizzes</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>20%</td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Participation</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Among Labs, Projects and Quizzes, your element with the strongest score will receive Weight 1, your element with the second strongest score will receive Weight 2 and your element with the weakest score will receive weight 3. The Class Participation score is worth 10% for all students.</p>
<p>I will determine your final course grade using the following scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>course averages of 89.0% to 100% will receive a A</li>
<li>course averages of 85.0% to 88.9% will be reviewed more closely to determine whether the grade will be A or B</li>
<li>course averages of 70.0% to 84.9% will receive a B</li>

<p>For students in the 85.0-88.9% range, students who have improved from the first half of the course to the second will be more likely to receive an A than those whose performance has declined.</p>
<p>Students whose course average is near or below 70% will usually need to take an Incomplete to improve their work before I assign a final grade.</p>

<h1 number="15"><span class="header-section-number">15</span> On Writing, Presenting &amp; Communicating</h1>
<p>I write all the time. It’s my job. It’s yours, too. You’ll do more of it here than you may be expecting in this class, and in life. So you’ll need to take advantage of every opportunity you have to write more effectively tomorrow than you do today.</p>
<p>Here’s what I find to be a compelling argument from George Cobb …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want your work with data to make a difference, devote time and effort to choosing the words and pictures you use to present your evidence and conclusions. If you teach or supervise, seek to reward those - they who learn from you, and they who report to you – when they spend time crafting their message.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Think back to the last “report” you were expected to read. Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind.</p>

<h2 number="15.3"><span class="header-section-number">15.3</span> A Few Tips from Professor Love</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Statistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7.</li>
<li>Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables.</li>
<li>Don’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in my words is, technically, plagiarism.</li>
<li>Edit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results.</li>
<li>Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary.</li>
<li>Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate.</li>
<li>Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well.</li>
<li>Data are plural. Use “the data <strong>are</strong> …” rather than “the data <em>is</em> …”</li>
<li>A paragraph must contain more than one sentence.<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout.</li>
<li>Don’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result.</li>
<li>Similarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in.</li>
<li>If you want to write that you used <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval.<br />
</li>
<li>If you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a <em>p</em>-value, then you should state something like:
<ul>
<li>[1] We’re using a 95% confidence level.</li>
<li>[2] We’re using a 5% significance level.<br />
</li>
<li>[3] We’re using <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t use more than one of these expressions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Again, don’t use <em>p</em>-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all <em>p</em>-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.001\)</span>, rather than, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.00000001\)</span> or, worse yet, <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span>. In a similar vein, write all <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values that exceed 0.99 as <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.99\)</span> instead of, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, don’t use <code>computer-ese</code> to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage.</li>
<li>When in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking, clear writing.</li>

<p>Case Western Reserve University has a wide range of student support resources on campus. These resources can assist students both in the classroom and outside of it. CWRU offers these resources to enrich and enhance each student’s academic experience and to create an environment that encourages personal growth and development. The Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences provides a detailed list <a href="https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/resources/campus-resources">on its website in the Resources section</a>. Please take advantage of these resources.</p>
